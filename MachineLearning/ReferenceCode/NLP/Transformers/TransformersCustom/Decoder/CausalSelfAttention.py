# This is also know as masked self-attention
# It is causal as it requires the model to only look at the past
# Causality will imply to adjust the attention weights matrix to not look at the future
# 
# To accomplish this, we need to make sure that the attention weights matrix is lower triangular
# or for a cell A(i,j), which is how much token i should pay attention to token j 
# should have value 0 if i < j (or when i comes before j)
# and value != 0 when i >= j (or when i comes after j)
#  
# This is accomplished by using a causal which is a lower triangular matrix
# as the lower triangular matrix will have 0s in the upper triangle
