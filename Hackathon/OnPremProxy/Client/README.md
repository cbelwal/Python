**Client Proxy**

This is the client module which will run on-prem and will maintain a WSS connection to the server proxy.

The stateful WSS connection will allow any requestion coming in to the Server Proxy to be immediately forwarded to the client proxy as a serialized string for RequestObject Class.

The serialized string is then used to reconstrcut RequestObject and the data in it is used to make the REST call the the OnPrem system. The Response received is then passed back to Server Proxy as serialization of ResponseObject.

GUID for each request is generated by the server proxy and is contained inside RequestObject.
